The widgets include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the comments widget;</li>\n  <li>the web-push notifications subscription button;</li>\n  <li>the email collection widget.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When necessary, visitors will need to log in using either a <em>LinkedIn</em> or <em>GitHub</em> account, so that <em>Akashic.Page</em> can verify that they are real users, and not computer programs, known as \"bots\". This measure is implemented to improve the quality of content and increase security (e.g., to prevent abusing the service for such attacks as <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/412316/how-email-bombing-uses-spam-to-hide-an-attack/\">\n  subscription bombs</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The widgets from <em>Akashic.Page</em> do not use or set any 3rd party cookies, including from such services as <em>Google Analytics</em>. Your data is never sold or transferred to 3rd parties.</p>\n\n<p class=\"SectionBreak\">\n  <a title=\"Back To Top\" href=\"#top\">\n    <img alt=\"section break\"\n      src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='40' height='15'/%3E\" data-io>\n    <noscript><img alt=\"section break\" src=\"/section-breaks/0.svg\"></noscript></a>\n</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"definitions\">Definitions</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>We, us: <em>Akashic.Page</em> marketing application created by <strong>Art Deco Code</strong>, a software development company in London (see the bottom of the page for contact information).</li>\n  <li>Login provider: a social network or other service that allows to login using their account, such as <em>LinkedIn</em> and <em>GitHub</em>.</li>\n  <li>Visitors: those users that see JavaScript widget integrated on websites.</li>\n  <li>You: the subject of this terms and conditions for processing of personal data.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"SectionBreak\">\n  <a title=\"Back To Top\" href=\"#top\">\n    <img alt=\"section break\"\n      src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='40' height='13'/%3E\" data-io>\n    <noscript><img alt=\"section break\" src=\"/section-breaks/1.svg\"></noscript></a>\n</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"comments\">Comments</h2>\n\n<p>To leave a comment, we use 2 login provides: <em>LinkedIn</em> and <em>GitHub</em>. We acquire the most basic with the least possible permissions that are possible to set: <code><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/references/v2/profile/lite-profile\">\n  r-liteprofile</a></code> for <em>LinkedIn</em> and <code>NO scope</code> for <em>GitHub</em>. When you decide to sign in to comment using the OAuth buttons, some cookies will be stored. They include 2 items: <span class=\"tm\">koa:sess</span> and <span class=\"tm\">koa:sign</span>. <strong>koa:sess</strong> is a base-64 encoded collection of information which was obtained when you signed in, and <strong>koa:sign</strong> is the key used to verify the integrity of this object on the server. The following data is recorded in the session cookie for the period of 1 year:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><span class=\"tm2\">linkedin_user</span>: id (MemberID unique to our app which cannot be used to deduct your public <em>LinkedIn</em> profile by anyone including <em>Akashic.Page</em>), firstName, lastName, profilePicture.</li>\n  <li><span class=\"tm2\">github_user</span>: login, name, avatar<em>url, html</em>url. These are public fields that can be obtained by visiting your profile anonymously.</li>\n  <li><span class=\"tm2\">csrf</span>: the cross-site-request-forgery token that is required for security reasons to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.</li>\n  <li><span class=\"tm2\">github-code</span> and <span class=\"tm2\">code</span>: simple numerical values (like 556) used during the authentication flow with <em>GitHub</em> and <em>LinkedIn</em> to store a random code used to prevent man-in-the-middle attack. It is deleted once the authentication is complete.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Your IP address is NOT recorded when you leave a comment.</p>\n\n<p>When you leave a comment, its text and the profile information from either or both of login providers is saved in the database. The data is held to facilitate exchange of opinions and will NOT be used for marketing/commercial communication purposes. When submitting the email form, you agree to let <em>Akashic.Page</em> store your LinkedIn and GitHub profile information, that is limited to your name, profile picture, and link to the GitHub profile when applicable.</p>\n\n<p>To delete your comments in case you were signed in, authorise again either via <em>LinkedIn</em> or <em>GitHub</em>, and click on the delete button. The record with all your stored profile personal data will be removed from the database, but might be kept in back-ups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"SectionBreak\">\n  <a title=\"Back To Top\" href=\"#top\">\n    <img alt=\"section break\"\n      src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='40' height='13'/%3E\" data-io>\n    <noscript><img alt=\"section break\" src=\"/section-breaks/2.svg\"></noscript></a>\n</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"web-push-button\">Web-Push Button</h2>\n\n<p>Web push is a new technology that allows visitors to subscribe to notifications via their browsers and devices. In this case, no personal data is used in the process, as completely anonymous endpoint address and user key, e.g., <span class=\"tm\">https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send/dMderPtz9q8:APA91bEUfHA-fcrVjdL...</span>, <span class=\"tm\">BFNRHL5W9-L9eHSpLJjh2GTS01Yav_IV1KTGlf...</span>, are recorded to send messages to. The messages may include promotional information and lead to a URL upon click. No LinkedIn or GitHub information is stored.</p>\n\n<p class=\"SectionBreak\">\n  <a title=\"Back To Top\" href=\"#top\">\n    <img alt=\"section break\"\n      src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='28' height='9'/%3E\" data-io>\n    <noscript><img alt=\"section break\" src=\"/section-breaks/3.svg\"></noscript></a>\n</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"emails-widget\">Emails Widget</h2>\n\n<p>In case when visitors do not want to use anonymous web-push notification for any reason (e.g., if their browser does not allow that), they may sign up with their email address. To collect such address, the user must authenticate on <em>LinkedIn</em> with <span class=\"tm2\">r_liteprofile</span> scope or on <em>GitHub</em> with <span class=\"tm2\">user:email</span> scope to provide a valid e-mail address. We use this method to prevent unauthorised handling of email addresses and increase the quality of data. The email is recorded against either the LinkedIn Member ID (unique to our application, and without any profile data associated with it), or <em>GitHub</em> login. No other personal data apart from <span class=\"tm\">email</span> is stored.</p>\n\n<p>By agreeing with this Terms, you agree to let <em>Akashic.Page</em> process your email address for marketing and informational communication, such as newsletters and notifications about website updates.</p>\n\n<p>When you visit a website you've been email subscribed to, the widget will show that such subscription exists, and the \"Unsubscribe\" button will show up. By pressing on the button, the record with your email address will be removed from the database, which means that no more of your personal data with the email address will be processed further on this website.</p>\n\n<p class=\"SectionBreak\">\n  <a title=\"Back To Top\" href=\"#top\">\n    <img alt=\"section break\"\n      src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='28' height='9'/%3E\" data-io>\n    <noscript><img alt=\"section break\" src=\"/section-breaks/4.svg\"></noscript></a>\n</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"data-controller\">Data Controller</h2>\n\n<p>Your data is processed by:</p>\n\n<pre id=\"cb288\"><code class=\"undefined hljs\">  ART DECO CODE LIMITED,\n  Company number 11323401\n  International House, 24 Holborn Viaduct,\n  London, United Kingdom, EC1A 2BN</code></pre>\n\n<em>Art Decoâ„¢</em> is a small company and collects personal data only for marketing purposes, therefore it is <a\n  href=\"https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/data-protection-fee/exemptions/\">\n  exempt from registering</a> with ICO, however we strongly respect the GDPR framework.
